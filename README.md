## Multiverse: `vinput`; Virtual Device Automation Conviences
**URL** [multiverse-os.org](https://multiverse-os.org)


**TODO:** 
  **1)** What process is user input being entered into? (Like is it
  gnome-terminal? etc)

  **2)** What has been entered since the last <enter> or <carriage-return> (to
  check for types)

  **3)** Status of various toggles? (CapsLock, what keys are being held down,
   NumLock, etc)

  **4)** What stdout/stderror has been produced since the last <enter> or
   <carriage-return>

  **5)** Informationa about the machine the input is connected to (preferably, we
  would have a logical K(v)M switch, and be able to rotate between machines.

  **6)** In `uinput` lib, setup macros for the common key combos like
  <CTRL>+<ALT>+<DELTE> or <ALT>+<TAB>. Make it easy to define more on-the-fly.

  **7)** Track avaialble options in current window we can <TAB> between, what
   things can be clicked and what their x/y coordinates are.

  **8)** Generate realsitic USB id numbers, switch between different real
  keymaps

  **9)** Support unicode

  **10)** Support API with ability to do:
    **A)** Type("ls -lah")

    **B)** AltTab("window-name")



**Need to be able to ask the mouse:**
  **1)** Where the current location is?

  **2)** What window it has focused?

  **3)** What the cursor type is?

  **4)** Color underneath cursor?

  **5)** If highlighting text, what is highlighted?
